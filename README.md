# rust-aaf
Rust implementation of the Advanced Authoring Format

## Work in Progress

This is ALPHA SOFTWARE and is unsuitable for any purpose.

At this time only the stored format spec has been implemented: an AAF file
can be opened, its root object can be read as well as its available numeric-valued
properties and the object graph travered, as well as weak references. None of the
proper AAF object classes, types, metaclasses, object spec or editing protocol are
exposed and are very much a work-in-progress.
